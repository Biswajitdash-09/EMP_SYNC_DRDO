ðŸŽ¯ Key Architecture Patterns :

1. Component Organization :

Feature-based grouping: Components are organized by business domain (auth, employee, payroll, etc.)
Atomic design principles: UI components are separated from business logic components
Reusability focus: Common components in dedicated folders

2. State Management :

Context API: For global state (authentication, theme)
React Query: For server state management and caching
Custom hooks: For business logic abstraction

3. Backend Integration :

Supabase: Full-stack backend with PostgreSQL database
Type-safe: Generated TypeScript types from database schema
Real-time features: Using Supabase's real-time capabilities

4. Authentication Architecture :

Dual authentication: Separate contexts for admin and employee access
Route protection: Protected routes based on user roles
Session management: Persistent authentication state


ðŸ”§ Technology Stack :

Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
Styling: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI components
Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Authentication + Real-time)
State Management: React Query + Context API
Form Handling: React Hook Form + Zod validation
Routing: React Router DOM
Charts: Recharts for data visualization


ðŸ“Š Database Design :

The project includes comprehensive database tables for:

Employee Management: employees, employee_details, employee_documents
Leave Management: leave_requests, leave_types, leave_balances, holidays
Payroll System: payroll, salary_components
Time Tracking: attendance, attendance_logs
HR Management: hr_policies, company_policies, feedback
Performance: performance_reviews
System: notifications, support_tickets, profiles

Key Design Patterns :

Component Composition: Reusable, composable UI components
Custom Hooks: Business logic abstraction and reusability
Service Layer: Clean separation of API logic from UI components
Context Providers: Global state management for authentication
Type Safety: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage

Security Features :

JWT-based authentication with Supabase
Row-Level Security policies on all database tables
Role-based access control (Admin vs Employee)
Secure file upload handling
Input validation and sanitization
